In this session, presenters will introduce <em>lessons learned</em> as an activity that supports failure as a valuable component in the reflective learning process Â\\xa0(Cannon, &amp; Edmondson, 2005; Kapur, 2008) in two very different, yet complementary, learning communities.</p><p>Lessons learned is a pedagogical tool employed in Marine Corps fighter squadrons in which a group of highly trained, competitive fighter pilots are required to self-identify, critically examine, and discuss their recent failures in the aircraft. In a community where 80% of mishaps are at least partially caused by human error (Shappell &amp; Wiegmann, 1996), these roundtable conversations create an environment without stigma or repercussion, enabling participants to examine the root cause of failure and how to prevent its recurrence. In doing so, lessons learned becomes a valuable tactic (de Certeau, 2004) that empowers instructors and students alike (Matson, 1991; Schunk, 1984).Â\\xa0</p><p>In this session participants will engage in a <em>lessons</em> <em>learned</em> activity, and acquire tactics and resources for leveraging failure as an opportunity for self-reflection and community building in their own pedagogical practices.</p>',\n",

In a senior-level inorganic chemistry course at George Mason University, students created information graphics or infographics to communicate a scientific idea of interest to them. This flexible project required students to think creatively about unfamiliar elements and concepts. The details of the assignment, its assessment, and the student products will be presented in this poster.

Diagrams are one technique used in the classroom. Jill Larkin and Herbert Simon described the computational advantages of diagrams over text when used to communicate information in their 1987 article entitled â\\x80\\x9cWhy a Diagram is (Sometimes) Worth Ten Thousand Words.â\\x80\\x9d This presentation describes a novel abstract diagramming technique designed to be facilitated in the classroom. Using paper and crayons, the participants create three diagrams that represent the externalization of their own prior knowledge of concepts in a domain of study. The presentation illustrates how differences in prior knowledge can be visualized using diagrams with greater speed in less time than the traditional use of text-based descriptions. The student diagrams were shown to contain a hidden conceptual topology, one that is described by Egenhofer in his 1991 article entitled â\\x80\\x9cReasoning About Binary Topological Relations.â\\x80\\x9d This topology is recommended as a framework for structuring and facilitating student collaboration and sharing of prior knowledge and new learning.</p>',\n",

Its main objective is to help students understand, evaluate, and prepare themselves in terms of courses' expectations, time commitment, online communication, and technology requirements. In GGS 501, MOL students learn by example.

The studies applied Duffy\\'s (2002) definition for teacher vision: \"a personal stance on teaching that rises from deep within the inner teacher and fuels independent thinking\" (p. 334). Accordingly, we have our students write vision statements articulating what they are passionate about as future and current educators. The theory is that this vision will allow them to persevere in the difficult and low-status profession of teaching (Duffy 2002). We have found that teachers\\' visions influence their teaching decisions. However, teachers\\' biases and classroom contexts can serve as obstacles to implementing research-based instructional practices. Whether teaching in a specific content area or working with culturally and linguistically diverse students, visioning provides educators with the opportunity to reflect and further acknowledge their students through an introspective approach of why one teaches.

In PBI, instructors supply a scenario (the problem) which requires students\\r\\nto think critically, conduct research, and apply their new and prior knowledge to that problem. The problem is not an application of concepts conveyed in a lecture; rather, it is the event through which learning occurs. PBI is a student-centered, active learning approach to education that facilitates learning through self-discovery. This study builds on the growing interest in innovative instruction models within academic libraries. It takes social science classes as a test case because the subject areas (international relations and criminology) lend themselves to the creation of immediately relatable problem scenarios for instruction. Students bring to the classroom ideas and experiences about the social and political world, and PBI allows students to build on, explore, and question that background. The poster will first outline the educational theory behind PBI. It will then describe and assess the\\r\\nimplementation of PBI in for library instruction in conflict resolution and criminology classes.

Assigned as a group project, it requires investigating, analyzing, and organizing existing resources for evaluation into a narrative discussion and review, written to help orient those new to the subject. The assignment works well as a mechanism for getting students engaged in current reports from government agencies and NGO's that often provide the most up-to-date information on particular contexts and evaluation efforts, as well as general texts on evaluation and academic articles. Over time, I have adapted and further developed the assignment, using it at first to assist students in constructing resource handbooks for underdeveloped sectors of the field. As evaluation efforts have exploded in our field, the current focus is as often on information management, where students are confronted with an overwhelming quantity of information that they must learn to navigate, analyze and interpret.

In â\\x80\\x9ctraditionalâ\\x80\\x9d programming courses, instructors spend most of their time lecturing to large groups of students, with little class time to spend on active exercises or personal interaction. Students are not in control of the content delivery or its pacing, nor is it effectively communicated that practice is needed to master programming. Moreover, most practice is individual and graded strictly, meaning students suffer heavy penalties for minor slips while learning or collaborating. This past year we experimented with a self-paced version of introductory programming, where students spend class time working on problems in small groups at their own pace. Learning is intentional because students take responsibility for their learning, rather than waiting for the instructor. Our pass rates in the course improved by 25% with these modifications. We propose to demonstrate our innovations by leading the audience in a simulation of our self-paced, active learning, class by teaching the 'students' to solve a simple puzzle. Members of our instructional team will play the role of teaching assistants, who offer peer learning opportunities in our classrooms. Like students, the audience will have varying levels of previous exposure to these puzzles, so they will move through the exercises at their own pace. We will demonstrate how faculty can use immediate automated feedback, asynchronous online content, individual assessments with the ability to test up to five times, interventions, peer-learning, and mini-lectures to allow students to learn new skills at their own pace.</p>\",\n",

       " {'abstract': '<p>To many instructors, the cultivation of creative and reflective thinking contradicts a main aim of most university classes, the transmission of knowledge. The roots of this imagined opposition, thinking versus knowledge-transmission, is old. In the modern era, it originated early in the twentieth century when progressives, wanting to foster thinking skills, broke ranks with traditional instructors focused on the transmission of knowledge. Imagining creative thinking and knowledge acquisition as opposites, however, diminishes the importance of both. Knowledge is central to understanding contexts with potential value, while creative thinking skills are necessary to producing originality within (and thus enhancing) those contexts. Creativity requires both: originality and value.</p><p>This workshop has two aims. The first is for participants to understand the main elements of creative thinking. Grounded in research, the theoretical half of the workshop will cross disciplinary boundaries, as creativity in any discipline rests on the same elements of thinking. The second aim is for participants to experience an active learning model called Kanban2C (Kanban-to-Creativity), which fosters elements of creative thinking. Grounded in practice, this flexible instructional model â\\x80\\x93 suitable for use in many disciplines â\\x80\\x93 demonstrates how elements of creative thinking can develop in content-specific (knowledge-transmission) contexts. This workshop will be interactive and include several different hands-on creativity exercises to explore key elements of creativity. Then, participants will experience Kanban2C: work cooperatively, move around, think creatively, and, in the process, learn how to foster creativity while transmitting knowledge. Afterwards, participants will brainstorm ways to apply Kanban2C to their academic discipline.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0</p>',\n",

In the context of well-being scholarship, wise interventions can promote growth in knowledge and personal well-being, and data suggests that increases in resilience promote academic excellence. In this presentation, we discuss and demonstrate how instructors across academic disciplines and levels can deliver brief (30 minute) wise interventions to teach students the foundational concepts of resilience and in turn, help students build their personal reservoirs of resilience. We demonstrate an interactive framework for presenting these interventions: <em>do, understanding, learn, </em>and<em> apply</em>.

       " {'abstract': '<p>The testing effect is a phenomenon that predicts increased retention of material when individuals are tested on soon-to-be-recalled information (McDaniel, Anderson, Derbish, &amp; Morrisette, 2007). Although this effect is well documented in numerous studies, no study has looked at the impact that computer-based quizzes or online companion tools in a course can have on test performance. In addition to the use of online programs, it is important to understand whether or not the presentation of different question types can lead to increased or decreased student test performance. Although other pedagogical studies have looked at question order on student performance (Norman, 1954; Balch, 1989), none has looked at whether students exposed to questions in short answer format (testing <em>free recall</em>) before taking a multiple choice test (<em>recognition memory</em>) can lead to increased exam scores. The present study sought to understand how use of an online learning system (MindTap, Cengage) and test format order could affect final test scores. There were 5 exams (consisting of separate short answer and multiple choice sections) given to each set of Physiological Psychology students at George Mason University; each exam being worth 150 points. Results indicate that testing order (whether short-answer sections or multiple choice sections were taken first) impacts student test performance and this effect may be mediated by whether or not an online computer program is required. This research has implications for course organization and selection of test format, which may improve student performance.Â\\xa0</p>',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'A Personal Learning Environment or PLE is described as a process that helps students organize the influx of information and resources that they are faced with on a daily basis into a personalized digital learning space or experience. A PLE is primarily facilitated by cloud-based Web 2.0 technologies and services designed to help students create, organize, and share content, participate in collective knowledge generation, and manage their own meaning making. Hence, a PLE is student-designed around each studentâ\\x80\\x99s goals or learning approach. In a PLE, the student develops an individualized digital identity through the perceptual cues and cognitive affordances that the personalized learning environment provides such as what information to share and when, who to share it with, and how to effectively merge formal and informal learning experiences. To gather data on PLEs, Mason students were asked what do they like to learn about; what hardware (devices) and software do they use to learn; what digital tools they wish they had access to for learning; and what their ideal PLE might look like. In this presentation, we will share student responses to these questions and provide recommendations for supporting the development PLEs in teaching and learning contexts.',\n",
