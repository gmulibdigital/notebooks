       "[{'abstract': '<p>To many instructors, the cultivation of creative and reflective thinking contradicts a main aim of most university classes, the transmission of knowledge. The roots of this imagined opposition, thinking versus knowledge-transmission, is old. In the modern era, it originated early in the twentieth century when progressives, wanting to foster thinking skills, broke ranks with traditional instructors focused on the transmission of knowledge. Imagining creative thinking and knowledge acquisition as opposites, however, diminishes the importance of both. Knowledge is central to understanding contexts with potential value, while creative thinking skills are necessary to producing originality within (and thus enhancing) those contexts. Creativity requires both: originality and value.</p><p>This workshop has two aims. The first is for participants to understand the main elements of creative thinking. Grounded in research, the theoretical half of the workshop will cross disciplinary boundaries, as creativity in any discipline rests on the same elements of thinking. The second aim is for participants to experience an active learning model called Kanban2C (Kanban-to-Creativity), which fosters elements of creative thinking. Grounded in practice, this flexible instructional model â\\x80\\x93 suitable for use in many disciplines â\\x80\\x93 demonstrates how elements of creative thinking can develop in content-specific (knowledge-transmission) contexts. This workshop will be interactive and include several different hands-on creativity exercises to explore key elements of creativity. Then, participants will experience Kanban2C: work cooperatively, move around, think creatively, and, in the process, learn how to foster creativity while transmitting knowledge. Afterwards, participants will brainstorm ways to apply Kanban2C to their academic discipline.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0</p>',\n",

Despite the interest, introductory computer science course have relatively low completion rates (approximately 55% at Mason) and high rates of academic integrity violations. In response to this environment, the Computer Science department at Mason received an external grant to redesign their introductory programming courses to a self-paced, flipped format. Implementation began in Fall 2015 with a quasi-experimental methodology that tracks students from an experimental course and a control group (those who took more traditional introductory CS courses) over the course of the semester.

The EDLE online orientation was offered in 2015/2016 for two cohorts totaling 44 students. An overwhelming majority reported feeling more prepared to begin the program, comfortable with using the required technology, and engaged with their colleagues and professors.

In a PLE, the student develops an individualized digital identity through the perceptual cues and cognitive affordances that the personalized learning environment provides such as what information to share and when, who to share it with, and how to effectively merge formal and informal learning experiences. To gather data on PLEs, Mason students were asked what do they like to learn about; what hardware (devices) and software do they use to learn; what digital tools they wish they had access to for learning; and what their ideal PLE might look like. In this presentation, we will share student responses to these questions and provide recommendations for supporting the development PLEs in teaching and learning contexts.',\n",
